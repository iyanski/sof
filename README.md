  -d '{
    "shipment": {
      "originAddress": {"country": "SE"},
      "destinationAddress": {"country": "NO"},
      "packages": [{
        "id": "pkg_001",
        "quantity": 1,
        "weight": 5.5,
        "dimensions": {"length": 30, "width": 20, "height": 15}
      }]
    }
  }'
```

## üìä Scoring Signals

The scoring system uses two-tier signals: primary signals (delivery speed, environmental impact, cost efficiency) weighted at 70% for core business decisions, and secondary signals (weight efficiency, dimension efficiency, capacity utilization) weighted at 30% as tie-breakers, with both combined to determine overall eligibility against a configurable threshold.

## üìö API Documentation

### Interactive Documentation
The API includes comprehensive Swagger documentation accessible at `/api-docs` when the server is running. This provides:
- Interactive API testing interface
- Complete schema definitions
- Request/response examples
- Error response documentation

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
The API uses TypeScript DTOs for type-safe request/response handling:

- **`AddressDto`**: Country validation (2-character codes)
- **`PackageDto`**: Package information with dimensions and weight validation
- **`ShipmentDto`**: Complete shipment structure with nested validation
- **`OfferDto`**: Individual carrier offer details
- **`OfferRequestDto`**: API request structure
- **`OfferResponseDto`**: API response structure
- **`ErrorDto`**: Standardized error responses

### Validation
All inputs are validated using `class-validator` decorators:
- Required field validation
- Type checking (string, number, boolean)
- Range validation (min/max values)
- Array validation (minimum items, nested validation)
- Custom business rule validation

### Error Handling
The API implements comprehensive error handling:
- **Global Error Handler**: Catches all unhandled errors
- **Validation Errors**: Detailed field-level error messages
- **Structured Responses**: Consistent error format across all endpoints
- **Request Logging**: All requests and responses are logged
- **404 Handling**: Proper handling of unknown routes

## Assumptions about the Requirements

### **Business Logic Assumptions**
- **Cost is dynamic**: Cost ranges vary based on available carriers rather than fixed thresholds
- **Environmental impact matters**: Customers value sustainability as a primary decision factor (29.3% weight)
- **Cost efficiency is paramount**: Cost efficiency (35.7%) is the highest-weighted primary factor
- **Tie-breaking is needed**: Secondary signals are necessary for carrier differentiation

### **Data Quality Assumptions**
- **Carrier data is reliable**: `costPerKg`, `deliveryTime`, and `environmentalImpact` are accurate
- **Country codes are standardized**: Consistent country code format (SE, NO, DK, etc.)
- **Weight/volume units are consistent**: kg for weight and cm¬≥ for volume across all carriers

### **User Behavior Assumptions**
- **Transparency is valued**: Users want explanations for carrier selection decisions
- **Threshold-based decisions**: 70-point threshold is meaningful for business users
- **Multi-criteria evaluation**: Users consider multiple factors, not just cost or speed alone

### **Technical Assumptions**
- **Performance matters**: High-volume requests require optimized scoring algorithms
- **Configuration flexibility**: Business rules will change frequently enough to warrant complex config system
- **Rule complexity**: Carriers have diverse, complex eligibility rules requiring a rule engine

### **Operational Assumptions**
- **Real-time scoring**: Scoring must happen per-request rather than pre-computed
- **Carrier availability**: All configured carriers are always available for evaluation
- **Shipment validity**: Input shipments are properly formatted and within reasonable bounds

### **Business Model Assumptions**
- **Nordic/EU focus**: Primary market is Nordic countries with EU expansion
- **B2B logistics**: Enterprise customers with complex shipping requirements
- **Competitive pricing**: Cost efficiency is a key differentiator in the market

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  offerId: "offer_abc123", // Unique business identifier
  shipmentId: "ship_12345", // Reference to shipment
  
  // Embedded Carrier Data (denormalized for performance)
  carrier: {
    carrierId: "dhl-001",
    name: "DHL",
    deliveryTime: 3,
    environmentalImpact: 5,
    costPerKg: 10,
    supportedCountries: ["SE", "NO", "DK", "FI", "DE", "AT", "CH", "PL"]
  },
  
  // Pricing & Cost Information
  pricing: {
    baseCost: 55.00, // totalWeight * costPerKg
    costPerKg: 10.00,
    additionalFees: [
      { type: "fuel_surcharge", amount: 2.75 },
      { type: "insurance", amount: 3.00 }
    ],
    totalCost: 60.75,
    currency: "SEK"
  },
  
  // Delivery Information
  delivery: {
    estimatedDays: 3,
    estimatedDeliveryDate: ISODate("2024-01-18T17:00:00Z"),
    serviceLevel: "standard",
    trackingAvailable: true
  },
  
  // Complete Scoring Results (embedded for performance)
  scoring: {
    eligibilityScore: 85,
    primarySignal: 78,
    secondarySignal: 95,
    strategyScores: {
      "delivery-speed": 60,
      "environmental-impact": 80,
      "cost-efficiency": 95,
      "weight-efficiency": 100,
      "dimension-efficiency": 90,

    },
    isEligible: true,
    eligibilityThreshold: 70,
    reasons: [
      "competitive pricing: 10 SEK/kg",
      "good delivery speed: 3 days", 
      "optimal weight utilization"
    ]
  },
  
  // Shipment Context (minimal embedded data for queries)
  shipmentContext: {
    totalWeight: 5.5,
    totalVolume: 9000,
    originCountry: "SE",
    destinationCountry: "NO",
    packageCount: 1
  },
  
  // Offer Metadata
  metadata: {
    generatedAt: ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"),
    expiresAt: ISODate("2024-01-15T16:30:00Z"), // 6-hour validity
    status: "active", // active, expired, selected, cancelled
    selectedAt: null,
    customerId: "cust_67890",
    version: "1.2.0" // Algorithm version for tracking
  }
}
```

### **Indexing Strategy for Offers**

```javascript
// Primary lookup
db.offers.createIndex({ "offerId": 1 }, { unique: true })

// Shipment offers (most common query)
db.offers.createIndex({ "shipmentId": 1, "metadata.generatedAt": -1 })

// Active offers for selection
db.offers.createIndex({ 
  "metadata.status": 1, 
  "metadata.expiresAt": 1, 
  "scoring.isEligible": 1 
})

// Cost-based sorting and filtering
db.offers.createIndex({ "pricing.totalCost": 1 })

// Eligibility score sorting
db.offers.createIndex({ "scoring.eligibilityScore": -1 })

// Carrier performance analysis
db.offers.createIndex({ "carrier.carrierId": 1, "metadata.generatedAt": -1 })

// Route-based queries
db.offers.createIndex({ 
  "shipmentContext.originCountry": 1, 
  "shipmentContext.destinationCountry": 1 
})

// Customer offer history
db.offers.createIndex({ "metadata.customerId": 1, "metadata.generatedAt": -1 })

// Weight/volume range queries
db.offers.createIndex({ "shipmentContext.totalWeight": 1 })
db.offers.createIndex({ "shipmentContext.totalVolume": 1 })

// TTL for expired offers (cleanup after 30 days)
db.offers.createIndex({ "metadata.expiresAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 2592000 })
```

### **Schema Design Rationale**

#### **1. Denormalization Strategy**
- **Embedded carrier data**: Eliminates joins for offer display, but requires careful updates when carrier data changes
- **Embedded scoring results**: Stores complete eligibility calculation to avoid re-computation
- **Minimal shipment context**: Only essential fields needed for offer queries and sorting

#### **2. Document Structure Decisions**
- **Single collection approach**: All offer data in one document for optimal read performance
- **Nested objects for logical grouping**: `pricing`, `delivery`, `scoring`, `metadata` for clear organization
- **Array fields for flexible data**: `additionalFees`, `reasons` for variable-length data

#### **3. Performance Optimizations**
- **Compound indexes for common patterns**: Status + expiration + eligibility for active offers
- **Pre-calculated fields**: `totalCost`, `eligibilityScore` to avoid runtime calculations
- **TTL indexes**: Automatic cleanup of expired offers to prevent unbounded growth

#### **4. Query Patterns Supported**
- **Get all offers for a shipment**: `{ shipmentId: "ship_12345" }`
- **Find cheapest eligible offers**: `{ "scoring.isEligible": true }` sorted by `pricing.totalCost`
- **Get best scoring offers**: `{ "scoring.isEligible": true }` sorted by `scoring.eligibilityScore`
- **Carrier performance analysis**: `{ "carrier.carrierId": "dhl-001" }`
- **Route-based queries**: `{ "shipmentContext.originCountry": "SE", "shipmentContext.destinationCountry": "NO" }`

#### **5. Scalability Considerations**
- **Sharding strategy**: Shard by `metadata.customerId` for customer isolation
- **Read replicas**: Use for analytics queries without affecting transactional operations
- **Write optimization**: Batch inserts for offer generation during peak times
